# Application Organization

Trying to organize your application without looking at the larger macro system that it is operating inside of will hinder your ability to handle change.

I like to study the organization and understand its boundaries and departments. Look at its management structure, etc. This is often times where we will see various systems come into play.

This is also where we can see a lot of system anti patterns come into play.

I prefer to take a company's code repository and structure it after the applications and in doing so, align the software constructs to the business functions rather than the organizational units, when possible.
