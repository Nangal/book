# Job Description

> I'm tired of rewriting this using different terminology at each job. I'm capturing it once and for all in MY language how **I** want to see it.

## Titles
**Systems Xxxxx** - As much as I want to get wrapped up in titles I want to avoid it as much as possible. In my perfect world the title would have something to do with systems because ultimately we are here to optimize systems to provide increased value for your companies. That can be in the form of software or possibly just changing an existing human process.


## Requirements

Ability to think deeply about a problem. I'm personally not concerned about a degree in a specific field but I am much more interested in you ability to discuss a problem. How deep can you go into the problem space and come back with a solution that fits the business needs.

Ability to explain how you continue to educate yourself. Its all too common to see a developer with 20 years of experience that has simply repeated 1st grade for 20 years. I want to work with people who are actively growing. This doesn't need a crazy amount of work outside of company time but it does take effort to keep up with what is going on in the world. 

If you are a front end oriented developer I want to know that you know more about it then me. 

## Benefits

An expectation to learn on the clock. Meaning that if you work with me, I expect you to spend some time every week learning about how to become a better developer of systems. If you don't know how, ask me.
