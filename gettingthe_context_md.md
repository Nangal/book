# Getting the Context

Understanding the context or the company you work for helps us build better software. But how do we learn about our company? For that I think we need to have a richer understanding of "The Nature of the Firm".

## Why do companies grow?

Going from the solo entrepreneur, to making your first hire can be for many reasons. At its core I believe that firms will tend to hire people for one real reason. Abstracting out complexity from the entrepreneur.

In the beginning, a firm is an idea. A single entrepreneur can work on it, but at some point she will need help. I currently think that companies hire for two specific reasons.

1. To hide complexity
2. To hide volume (really a different kind of complexity)

### To Hide Subject Complexity

We hire accountants early on in the life of a company in the US because the tax code is so complex no one outside of the tax community is expected to fully understand it.

### To Hide Interaction Complexity i.e. Volume

We hire a customer service team to shield us from the sheer volume of interactions with our customer base. Volume is just another form of complexity.



## Next

Now that we have an understanding of why a company might grow, we can start to understand why it will bring on software systems.
