# Who Do Companies Grow?

Understanding the context or the company you work for helps us build better software. But how do we learn about our company? For that I think we need to have a richer understanding of "The Nature of the Firm".

## Why do companies grow?

Going from the solo entrepreneur, to making your first hire will happen for many reasons. At its core I believe that firms will tend to hire people for one real reason. Abstracting out complexity from the entrepreneur.

In the beginning, a firm is an idea. A single entrepreneur can work on it, but at some point she will need help. I currently think that companies hire for two specific reasons.

1. To hide subject complexity
2. To hide interaction complexity

### To Hide Subject Complexity

We hire accountants early on in the life of a company in the US because the tax code is so complex no one outside of the tax community is expected to fully understand it. Anytime a company runs into one of these "sharp" points, it invariable either hires someone to soften the point for them or they simply ignore it.

### To Hide Interaction Complexity

We hire a customer service team to shield us from the sheer volume of interactions with our customer base. Each interaction with a customer could be entirely unique and need a new mind set to address interacting with another human mind. Even when the interaction is not unique and is a part of the standard operating procedures (cancelling my account, etc) the sheer volume of these can overwhelm an entrepreneur.


## The Mechanical Turk

Now that we have an understanding of why a company might grow, we can start to understand why it will bring on software systems.

Software systems can replace well defined work that a human is currently doing. Once a system becomes so predictable that "a monkey could do it" that typically becomes the moment that automated systems start to appear attractive.

### Coase

Robert Coase argues that companies grow because using the market pricing system for transactions is inherently inefficient. It is this _transactional_ nature that I find the most interesting in regards to staffing, head count and software.

The transactional cost of software is effectively zero. We have systems that can process millions of transactions a second for the simple operating cost of a few servers (Roughly $50/mth in 2016). 

The cost of acquiring a software system is more akin to hiring someone than it is engaging a "contractor". The upfront cost is high as you must interview the provider of the service, but once you've agreed that the fit is good, the overall cost of the transactions virtually disappears.
