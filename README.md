This book documents the current state of my thoughts, ideas, and peculiarities around developing applications. As a veteran .Net developer this will be colored by my work with the .Net languages and environment. That said, I am open to any thoughts about this, but this whole document assumes that there is value in typed languages and static systems. If you disagree with that, then some of this may or may not make sense to your projects.
